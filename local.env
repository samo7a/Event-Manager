# Create your own .env file (not local.env) in your root folder and add it to your .gitignore
# This local.env will not contain the actual secret. 
# Go to the discord server for the key.
# Whenever you want to add to .env, put the name here and be sure to add the secret to the server so each member can add it
# Process.env will not access local.env, unless configured to do so (no recommended)
